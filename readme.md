# Viminal
This is my personal vim scripts and configs collection. The `vimrc` file is not included here (which merely contains some initialization stuff. If really interested in it, you can find it in my dotfile). Many scripts are copyed from or inspired by others' configurations.

It's a single `.vim` directory without utilizing a plugin manager. To try out just clone it (all the thirdparty plugins are made submodules, to download them all use `--recurse-submodules` option)
