# Viminal
My personal vim configuration set. The `vimrc` file is not included here (which merely contains some initialization stuff). Many included scripts are copyed or inspired by others'.

It's a single `.vim` directory without using a plugin manager, so to try out just clone it (all the thirdparty plugins are made submodules, to download them all use `--recurse-submodules` option)
